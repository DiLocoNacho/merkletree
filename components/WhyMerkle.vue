          Creating a whitelist of a few address for your NFT project is simple
          and really no big deal. But what happens when your whitelist grows to
          a couple hundred or even a couple thousand addresses? Using a mapping
          for this is crazy expensive and inefficient. A whitelist of a thousand
          addresses can easily cost your project 1 ETH in gas.

          <br />
          <br />
          A MerkleTree is an alternative solution to the expensive mapping
          problem. This solution is very cheap and used by big companies like
          Uniswap. Find our here how you should set up your MerkleTree today!
